Randomizer: Plugin requested by GGothicRide

everything you do, drops a random amount of something random! :P

- Tested on Spigot 1.14.4~ should work with 1.8-1.15.

build using gradle.

add it to your plugin's folder then restart.


- Note: This is really bad. I made this 7 months ago. I'm very inexperinced until now, so Imagine me then :P
